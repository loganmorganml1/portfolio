    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2> A graphic designer with a love for all things visual</h2>
    <p> Hello and thank you for checking out my site! When I put my mind to something I dedicate myself to making the best possible product it can be. Whether it be a comic, print, or website (like this one!) I will do everything in my power to learn, create, and adapt until happy with the results. I graduated with my BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2018, and because of an interest to learn code and web design I completed the Web Design Certificate Program at Loyola in 2021. I love to learn new things and look at all sources of mediums to help drive my creativity. When I'm not working on design you can find me working on my comic, walking my dog, or unwinding with a good book!</p>
