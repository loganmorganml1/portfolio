            <p>Because of my interest in coding, I participated in a continued education certificate program at Loyola that specialized in web design. The final group project was to create a company website. The parameters for what company could be were limitless, so we decided to have fun and create a travel agency website that was based off of the popular t.v. show Doctor Who. This led to the creation of Who Travels, a travel agency that lets you go anywhere, any time, in any world.<br><br> We all worked together on the code and used Github for a centralized repository. Having prior design experience, I constructed the wireframes and led the design layouts through Figma. This was my first large scale web design project, and my first time working with a team on Github. It was a lot of fun building something on such a large scale from the bottom up and seeing the design come to life.<br><br><a href="https://techeduk8r.github.io/who-travels/index.html" class="copy-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can acess the full site here.</a></p>

            <p>Working Smarter was a podcast from VillageMD whose mission was to bring “concise compliance conversations” to professionals in the healthcare sector that may not be as well versed on the ins and outs of compliance. I managed the podcast’s social media presence, as well as assisted in the recording and editing process of the episodes.<br><br> As part of a push for engagement, I created a variety of social media postings in reference to important observations, awarenesses, and holidays — both in relation to healthcare and in general. I established branding for our pages and content, as well as managed the video releases on Buzzsprout, Vimeo, and Youtube.</p>

            <h3 class="bold project-title">Legal Design</h3>
            <p>Working for VillageMD I helped redesign a variety of legal documents including our Notice of Privacy Practices, Physician Employment Agreement, and the VillageMD Code of Conduct to name a few. Usually these types of documents are filled with legalese and are hard for everyday people who aren’t lawyers to understand.<br><br> The idea behind these redesigns was to create documentation that felt easier to approach and comprehend. By using a layman’s approach to copy, easy to follow layout and graphics to explain more complex information, we provided materials that didn’t overwhelm viewers with a barrage of text and made the information easy to digest.</p>

            <p>Logo work has always been a joy to work with, and I’ve had the pleasure of working on logo design throughout my career. I view creating a logo sort of like a puzzle – you have to create something that is both visually interesting and easily tells the viewer what to expect from the product/service in addition to any constraints, whether it be branding guidelines or a client's request.<br><br> By working with all these pieces while designing and conceptualizing, it helps me approach the logo in new perspectives that I may not have seen before, and provide surprising results. Some of my favorite, and most notable, logos that I had created include logos for Fortress Consulting Group, Working Smarter, and — while a personal project, it’s still one of my favorites — Who Travels.</p>
