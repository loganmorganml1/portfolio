            <p>Because of my interest in coding, I participated in a continued education certificate program at Loyola that specialized in web design. The final group project was to create a company website. The parameters for what company could be were limitless, so we decided to have fun and create a travel agency website that was based off of the popular t.v. show Doctor Who. This led to the creation of Who Travels, a travel agency that lets you go anywhere, any time, in any world.<br><br> We all worked together on the code and used Github for a centralized repository. Having prior design experience, I constructed the wireframes and led the design layouts through Figma. This was my first large scale web design project, and my first time working with a team on Github. It was a lot of fun building something on such a large scale from the bottom up and seeing the design come to life.<br><br><a href="https://techeduk8r.github.io/who-travels/index.html" class="copy-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can acess the full site here.</a></p>

            <p>Working Smarter was a podcast from VillageMD whose mission was to bring “concise compliance conversations” to professionals in the healthcare sector that may not be as well versed on the ins and outs of compliance. I managed the podcast’s social media presence, as well as assisted in the recording and editing process of the episodes.<br><br> As part of a push for engagement, I created a variety of social media postings in reference to important observations, awarenesses, and holidays — both in relation to healthcare and in general. I established branding for our pages and content, as well as managed the video releases on Buzzsprout, Vimeo, and Youtube. Along with this, I would also assist at times the social media content for VillageMD or Village Medical.</p>

            <p>Working for VillageMD I helped redesign a variety of legal documents including our Notice of Privacy Practices, Physician Employment Agreement, and the VillageMD Code of Conduct to name a few. Usually these types of documents are filled with legalese and are hard for everyday people who aren’t lawyers to understand.<br><br> The idea behind these redesigns was to create documentation that felt easier to approach and comprehend. By using a layman’s approach to copy, easy to follow layout and graphics to explain more complex information, we provided materials that didn’t overwhelm viewers with a barrage of text and made the information easy to digest.</p>

            <h3 class="bold project-title white-text">Logo Work</h3>
            <p>Logo work has always been a joy to work with, and I’ve had the pleasure of working on logo design throughout my career. I view creating a logo sort of like a puzzle – you have to create something that is both visually interesting and easily tells the viewer what to expect from the product/service in addition to any constraints, whether it be branding guidelines or a client's request.<br><br> By working with all these pieces while designing and conceptualizing, it helps me approach the logo in new perspectives that I may not have seen before, and provide surprising results. Some of my favorite, and most notable, logos that I had created include logos for Fortress Consulting Group, Working Smarter, and — while a personal project, it’s still one of my favorites — Who Travels.</p>

           <p>While building out our company Intranet we wanted to put together images for quick snapshots of what each policy contained. The idea was to understand a policy at a glance with the ability to select the policy to review for more in depth information if needed. Because we wanted these images to feel light and friendly, I kept with a simplistic vector design in the company branded colors paired with the fun aspects of animation bits. The GIFs would play once as the viewer scrolled past and, when finished, leave the snapshot of the policy on display. For confidentiality reasons, the wording for these snapshots have been blurred from view in these examples.</p><br>

           <h3 class="bold project-title white-text">Freelance Work</h3>
           <p>I have taken on a variety of freelance projects over the years. Some of the more notable projects include T-shirt designs for the Hononegah Girls Cross Country Team, branding work for the podcast “The Weekly American”, and a variety of resume layouts to help people stand out in their respective fields. I approach my freelance work like I do with most projects, communicating with the client through each step to make sure we are moving in the right direction. After an initial interview asking questions about their goals, preferences, and insights on how they want the design to be perceived I conduct my own research on the organization and put together an initial draft with two to three options. From there we can narrow down a consistent design and make minimal version changes.<br><br>I do my best to make sure that the final product is one that the client is happy with, and continuously ask questions and for their input on the project to pinpoint what parts make them happy and which to change. Working with people who may not necessarily have experience in design, I find this helpful to draw out more constructive criticism on the works and why they feel the way they do about a certain design.

           <p>During my freetime I like to explore different creative mediums. I love to draw, and have recently begun putting together a comic. I feel that my interest in art in general helps me look at my design in fun and creative ways. I find that my drawing abilities are also an asset to the ideation phase of design for products such as logos, icons, and other illustrative visuals.</p>
