            <p>I pursued my interest in coding by enrolling in a web design certificate program at Loyola University. As part of the program, we were tasked with creating a company website for our final project. With no restrictions on the type of company we could choose, my group decided to have some fun and create a travel agency website based on the popular TV show Doctor Who. This gave rise to Who Travels, a travel agency that offers trips to any location, any time, and any world.<br><br>As a team, we collaborated on coding and used Github as a centralized repository for our work. Leveraging my prior design experience, I developed wireframes and led the design process using Figma. This was my first opportunity to work on a large-scale web design project and my first experience collaborating with a team on Github. It was gratifying to see a design project on such a large scale from the bottom up come to life.<br><br><a href="https://techeduk8r.github.io/who-travels/index.html" class="copy-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can acess the full site here.</a></p>

            <p>I had the pleasure of managing the social media presence of Working Smarter, a podcast from VillageMD. I created a range of compelling social media content to enhance the podcast's reach and connect with healthcare professionals who may not be well-versed in compliance regulations.<br><br>To foster a deeper connection with our audience, I developed diverse social media posts that highlighted critical healthcare observations, awareness days, and general holidays. I was also responsible for establishing a branding strategy for our pages and content, as well as overseeing the release of video content on various platforms, including Buzzsprout, Vimeo, and YouTube. Additionally, I had also assisted with social media content for VillageMD and Village Medical.</p>

            <p>During my time at VillageMD, I had the opportunity to contribute to the redesign of various legal documents, including the Notice of Privacy Practices, Physician Employment Agreement, and the VillageMD Code of Conduct. These documents typically contain complex legalese, making them difficult for non-lawyers to comprehend.<br><br>To address this challenge, we aimed to create documents that were more approachable and easier to understand. Our approach involved simplifying the copy, utilizing an intuitive layout, and incorporating graphics to illustrate complex information. By doing so, we created materials that didn't overwhelm viewers with text and instead made the information more digestible.

            <p>Designing logos has always been a passion of mine, and I've had the privilege of working on logo projects throughout my career. To me, creating a logo is like solving a puzzle. It requires finding a balance between creating a visually appealing design and clearly communicating the product or service it represents, all while working within branding guidelines or the client's specific requests.<br><br>I love the challenge of working with these pieces and approaching each logo design from different angles to create unique and unexpected results. Some of my most memorable and noteworthy logo projects include the Fortress Consulting Group redesign, Working Smarter, and a personal project, Who Travels, which remains one of my favorites to this day.</p>

            <p>While building out our company Intranet we wanted to put together images for quick snapshots of what each policy contained. The idea was to understand a policy at a glance with the ability to select the policy to review for more in depth information if needed. Because we wanted these images to feel light and friendly, I kept with a simplistic vector design in the company branded colors paired with the fun aspects of animation bits. The GIFs would play once as the viewer scrolled past and, when finished, leave the snapshot of the policy on display. For confidentiality reasons, the wording for these snapshots have been blurred from view in these examples.</p><br>

            <p>I have worked on various freelance projects over the years, including T-shirt designs for the Hononegah Girls Cross Country Team, branding for the podcast "The Weekly American," and creating resume layouts to help individuals stand out in their respective fields. When taking on a freelance project, I prioritize clear communication with the client at every step to ensure we are moving in the right direction.<br><br>My process typically involves conducting an initial interview with the client to understand their goals, preferences, and desired perception of the design. Then, I conduct my own research on the organization and present two to three initial draft options. From there, we can narrow down a consistent design and make minimal version changes.<br><br>Throughout the project, I consistently seek client input and feedback to ensure their satisfaction with the final product. Working with clients who may not have design experience, I find that asking for their constructive criticism on the design helps me pinpoint which aspects to improve and adjust. Ultimately, my goal is to deliver a final product that the client is happy with.

            <p>Throughout my career, I have been involved in a lot of work that I am proud of. I enjoy collaborating with a team to bring a concept to life, and I find that having multiple experts on board enhances the outcome of the project. However, what I am currently most proud of is developing this website from scratch. Despite encountering technical issues, I persisted in problem-solving and utilized various resources to create something entirely my own. While I have explored a wide range of design specializations throughout my professional life, web design, despite being occasionally frustrating, gives me a greater sense of accomplishment and job satisfaction. I aspire to pursue a future role that emphasizes web design to further my knowledge and skills in the field.</p>
