            <p>When taking classes for my continued education certificate in web design through Loyola, our final project was to create a company website in groups. Since this could be anything, we decided to have fun with it and create a travel agency based off of the popular tv show Who Travels. Having prior design experience, I took control of the page design layouts using Figma and worked together with my teammates on the coding. This was my first large scale webdesign project, and my first time working with a team on Github. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to help bring the pages to life, as well as to ensure our webpages were using responsive and accessible design.</p>

            <p>I did a lot of work for Working Smarter, a podcast whose mission was to bring concise compliance conversations to healthcare professionals. That included managing and creating content for their social media. Along with promoting the podcast releases, we used the social media to engage with our audience on a variety of observations and holidays ranging from Eid ul Adha to Hispanic Heritage Month to International Patient Safety Day. The podcast creator was not a huge fan of photos, so I created a lot of flat vector designs for the visuals. </p>

            <p>While at VillageMD I worked with the legal deparment in creating a variety of legal documents utilizing design in a way that helps the readers understand and feel at ease with content that usually feels daunting, both in comprehension and in the formality of it all. We did this by using more laymen terms in subjects that usually relay heavily in legalese, crafting intuitive and easy to follow layouts, and incorporating graphics to help explain complex information. Some legal documents I helped create and/or design include our Notice of Privacy Practices, the Physician Employment Agreement form, the VillageMD Code of Conduct, and flyer information about our compliance and risk team services.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career logo design has been apart of my work in one way or another. I find logo work to be so much fun to play with and treat each one like a puzzle, trying to figure out the best way to shine a personality on a brand or concept with the restraints and guidelines present. Some of my favorite (and most notable) logos that I had created include the Fortress logo for Fortress Consulting Group, the Working Smarter podcast logo, and — while not exactly for a 'real' company, still so much fun to make — the Who Travels logo.</p>
